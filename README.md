# GameJam2SGC
Check releases for the binary. Only compiled for windows.

This game is meant to be a mobile game. It was made in unity, but is currently just compiled for windows.

The goal of the game is to reach the top of a 10x10 grid as many times as possible. Each time you reach the top, you choose from 3 restrictions what you can't do next time through the grid. These restrictions accumulate and so each round is harder than the last. How many restrictions can you make it through the grid with at once?

Controls:  
WASD or Arrow Keys to move
Mouse for clicking stuff
